                <h2>Rules of Badminton</h2>
                <p>In a badminton match, the court size for a single's game is 44 feet long X 17 feet wide and for a
                    doubles match it is 44 feet long X 20 feet wide. The height of the net is 5 feet.
                    The primary objective is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into the opponent's court, scoring points in the process. Here are some basic rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A game starts with a coin toss. Whoever wins the toss gets to decide whether they would
                        serve or receive first OR what side of the court they want to be on. The side losing the toss shall
                        then exercise the remaining choice.</li>
                    <li>At no time during the game should the player touch the net, with his racquet or his body.</li>
                    <li>The shuttlecock should not be carried on or come to rest on the racquet</li>
                    <li>A player should not reach over the net to hit the shuttlecock.</li>
                    <li>A serve must carry cross court (diagonally) to be valid.</li>
                    <li>During the serve, a player should not touch any of the lines of the court, until the server
                        strikes the shuttlecock. During the serve the shuttlecock should always be hit from below the
                        waist.</li>
                    <li>A point is added to a player's score as and when he wins a rally</li>
                    <li>A player wins a rally when he strikes the shuttlecock and it touches the floor of the
                        opponent's side of the court or when the opponent commits a fault. The most common type of
                        fault is when a player fails to hit the shuttlecock over the net or it lands outside the boundary of
                        the court.</li>
                    <li>Each side can strike the shuttlecock only once before it passes over the net. Once hit, a player
                        can't strike the shuttlecock in a new movement or shot.</li>
                    <li>The shuttlecock hitting the ceiling is counted as a fault.</li>
                </ul>
